Stack
depth(): int
push(object)
pop(): object

if first element is null, then when we pop
we return null, and first element remains null
and depth remains 0

if the first element is some object, then when
we pop, we decrement depth by 1, we return first
element, and first element's next element 
attribute becomes the new value of first element

Queue
length(): int
enqueue(object)
dequeue(): object

If the first(top) element of a queue
is null, then the bottom element
must be null.

If the last(bottom) element of a queue
is null, does that mean that the first
(top) element is null?
